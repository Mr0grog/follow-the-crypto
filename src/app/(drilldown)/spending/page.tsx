          However, spending to oppose Democrats does not always support
          Republicans, and vice versa. For example, when a PAC opposes a
          candidate in a primary against a candidate from the same party, they
          may be supporting a different candidate from the same party â€” or they
          may intend to support a candidate from the opposing party in a later
          election.
