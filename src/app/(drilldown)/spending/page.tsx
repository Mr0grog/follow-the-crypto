          Cryptocurrency-focused PACs have contributed to both support and

        <p>
          However, spending to oppose Democrats does not always support
          Republicans, and vice versa. For example, when a PAC opposes a
          candidate in a primary against a candidate from the same party, they
          may be supporting a different candidate from the same party â€” or they
          may intend to support a candidate from the opposing party in a later
          election.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some races where PACs have spent heavily to oppose candidates but
          have not supported any candidates, such as in{" "}
          <Link href="/elections/CA-S">California&rsquo;s Senate primary</Link>{" "}
          and in{" "}
          <Link href="/elections/NY-H-16">
            New York&rsquo;s District 16 Democratic primary
          </Link>
          , these PACs seem more focused on ousting candidates they view as
          anti-crypto, rather than supporting any specific candidate. The
          incidental beneficiaries in these cases are marked in lighter italic
          text in the table below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on committee support spending, individual contributions to other
          candidates, and statements supporting other candidates, opposition
          spending can be categorized based on likely beneficiary:
