          Cryptocurrency-focused PACs have contributed to both support and

        <p>
          However, spending to oppose Democrats does not always support
          Republicans, and vice versa. For example, when a PAC opposes a
          candidate in a primary against a candidate from the same party, they
          may be supporting a different candidate from the same party â€” or they
          may intend to support a candidate from the opposing party in a later
          election.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on committee support spending, individual contributions to other
          candidates, and statements supporting other candidates, opposition
          spending can be categorized based on likely beneficiary:
